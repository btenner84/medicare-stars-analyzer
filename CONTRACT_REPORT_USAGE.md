## Understanding the Output

### Column Breakdown

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Measure** | Measure code and name | C01: Breast Cancer Screening |
| **Star** | Star rating (1-5) | 4‚≠ê |
| **Performance** | Actual performance value | 76.0% |
| **Cut Point Band** | Threshold range for that star | 76.0% to <84.0% |

### Reading the Cut Point Band

**Standard range**: `76.0% to <84.0%`
- Performance ‚â•76% and <84% = 4 stars
- To get 5 stars, need ‚â•84%

**Open upper bound**: `84.0%+`
- Performance ‚â•84% = 5 stars (no upper limit)

**Open lower bound**: `<58.0%`
- Performance <58% = 1 star (no lower limit)

**Inverse measures** (lower = better):
- C18 Readmissions: `>9.0% to 10.0%` = 3 stars (lower is better!)
- C28 Complaints: `>0.11 to 0.32` = 4 stars (fewer complaints = better!)

### Special Status Values

When you see these instead of numeric performance:
- **"Plan too small to be measured"** - < 11 enrollees
- **"Plan too new to be measured"** - First 3 years (hold harmless)
- **"Not enough data available"** - Sample size too low
- **"Plan not required to report measure"** - Type exemption (normal)
- **"Medicare shows only a Star Rating"** - Raw value suppressed (C30, D04)

## Advanced Usage

### Finding All 5-Star Contracts

```bash
for contract in H1290 H1537 H0524 H1230 H1248; do
    echo "===================="
    echo "Contract: $contract"
    python3 contract_report.py $contract | grep "Overall Rating"
    echo ""
done
```

### Comparing Similar Contracts

```bash
# Compare all UnitedHealth contracts
python3 contract_report.py H0169 > UHC_Wisconsin.txt
python3 contract_report.py H0251 > UHC_RiverValley.txt
python3 contract_report.py H0294 > UHC_Insurance.txt
```

### Exporting to File

```bash
# Save report to file
python3 contract_report.py H0028 > H0028_report.txt

# Save and view
python3 contract_report.py H1290 | tee H1290_report.txt
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Contract not found"
- Check contract ID spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify contract exists in 2026 data
- Try with quotes: `python3 contract_report.py "H0028"`

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
- Ensure you're in the correct directory: `/Users/bentenner/Stars2.0`
- Check all modules exist:
  - `data_parsers.py`
  - `threshold_parser.py`
  - `measure_config.py`
  - `contract_report.py`

### Threshold shows "N/A"
- This is normal for:
  - Special status measures (too small, too new, etc.)
  - C30 and D04 (Quality Improvement - no raw values)
- If numeric measure shows N/A, check cut points file

## What's Next?

### Phase 6: Gap Analysis (Optional Enhancement)

Add a new feature to show "how far to next star":

```python
# Example output:
C01: Breast Cancer - Currently 4‚≠ê (76%), need 84% for 5‚≠ê ‚Üí Gap: +8%
C22: Getting Care - Currently 3‚≠ê (81), need 82 for 4‚≠ê ‚Üí Gap: +1 point
```

### Phase 7: Batch Mode (Future Enhancement)

Process multiple contracts:

```python
# Example:
python3 batch_report.py --parent "Humana Inc."
# Generates reports for all Humana contracts
```

### Phase 8: Excel Export (Future Enhancement)

Generate Excel files with formatting:

```python
python3 contract_report.py H0028 --excel
# Creates H0028_report.xlsx with color coding
```

---

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. **Focus on High-Weight Measures**
Not all measures are equal! These matter most:
- **C18**: Readmissions (3x weight)
- **C14**: Blood Pressure Control (3x weight)
- **C11-C13**: Diabetes trilogy (important)
- **D08-D10**: Adherence trio (critical for Part D)

### 2. **Look for Quick Wins**
Best improvement opportunities:
- Currently 3‚≠ê or below
- Within 1-3 points/percent of next star
- Not a special status

### 3. **Watch Inverse Measures**
Don't get confused by C18, C28, D02:
- C18 (Readmissions): Lower % = Better
- C28/D02 (Complaints): Lower rate = Better

### 4. **Understand MA-PD vs PDP**
Part D measures have different thresholds:
- **MA-PD** (H-contracts): Slightly easier thresholds
- **PDP** (S-contracts): Stricter thresholds
- Same performance = different stars!

## Success Metrics

You now have a tool that:
- ‚úÖ **Loads** all 2026 Star Ratings data
- ‚úÖ **Displays** all 45 measures for any contract
- ‚úÖ **Shows** star ratings with cut point bands
- ‚úÖ **Handles** special values gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Supports** both Part C and Part D

---

## Questions?

**Common Questions**:

1. **Why do some bands look odd?**
   - MA-PD vs PDP have different thresholds
   - Inverse measures read opposite direction
   - Some measures use exact values (100%)

2. **Can I export to Excel?**
   - Not yet, but easy to add (Phase 8)
   - For now, redirect to file: `> report.txt`

3. **Can I compare two contracts?**
   - Run both and compare outputs
   - Batch mode coming in Phase 7

4. **How do I update data for 2027?**
   - Replace CSV files with 2027 data
   - No code changes needed!
   - Schema should be consistent year-to-year
