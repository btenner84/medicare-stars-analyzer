## How Stars Work

### The Rating System

```
‚≠ê 1 Star   = Poor
‚≠ê‚≠ê 2 Stars  = Below Average  
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 3 Stars  = Average
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 4 Stars  = Above Average (BONUS ELIGIBLE)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 5 Stars  = Excellent (BONUS ELIGIBLE + Year-Round Marketing)
```

### The Process

```
1. DATA COLLECTION (2024)
   ‚Üì
   Claims data, member surveys, pharmacy data
   
2. MEASURE CALCULATION (Early 2025)
   ‚Üì
   Calculate percentages/rates for each of 45 measures
   [Measure Data.csv]
   
3. STAR ASSIGNMENT (Mid 2025)
   ‚Üì
   Compare to thresholds ‚Üí assign 1-5 stars per measure
   [Cut Points.csv] + [Measure Data.csv] = [Measure Stars.csv]
   
4. AGGREGATION (Late 2025)
   ‚Üì
   Weight measures ‚Üí domain scores ‚Üí summary ratings
   [Summary Ratings.csv]
   
5. PUBLICATION (October 2025)
   ‚Üì
   Published on Medicare.gov for 2026 enrollment period

```

**Key Finding**: Most plans cluster around 3.0-3.5 stars. Breaking into 4+ territory requires targeted excellence.

### Common Data Values

**Special Statuses** (not numeric ratings):
- "Plan too small to be measured" - Low enrollment (< 11 members or insufficient sample)
- "Not enough data available" - Sample size requirements not met
- "Plan not required to report" - Type exemption (e.g., PDPs don't report Part C)
- "Plan too new to be measured" - First 3 years exempt

**Prevalence**: ~15-20% of measure values have special status rather than numeric ratings.

### Major Plan Families

**By Parent Organization** (contracts with 4+ overall):

| Parent Org | Brand Names | High Performers |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Kaiser Foundation | Kaiser Permanente | Multiple 4.5 stars |
| UnitedHealth Group | UnitedHealthcare | Multiple 4.0-4.5 |
| Humana Inc. | Humana | Several 4.0+ |
| Centene Corporation | Wellcare, Health Net, Allwell | Mix of 3.5-4.0 |
| Devoted Health | Devoted Health | 5.0 stars (FL) |

## Use Cases

### 1. Quality Improvement Prioritization

**Question**: Which measures should we improve to maximize our star rating?

**Approach**:
1. Identify measures where we're 1-2 stars
2. Calculate gap to next star threshold
3. Check weight of measure in overall calculation
4. Prioritize high-weight measures with small gaps

**Example Output**:
```
Priority 1: C14 (Blood Pressure) - Currently 74% (2‚≠ê), need 75% for 3‚≠ê ‚Üí Only 1% gap!
Priority 2: C22 (Getting Needed Care) - Currently 77 (1‚≠ê), need 78 for 2‚≠ê ‚Üí 1 point gap
Priority 3: D08 (Diabetes Adherence) - Currently 82% (1‚≠ê), need 83% for 2‚≠ê ‚Üí 1% gap
```

### 2. Competitive Benchmarking

**Question**: How do we compare to our competitors in our market?

**Approach**:
1. Filter contracts by geographic region and plan type
2. Calculate percentiles for each measure
3. Identify where we're top quartile vs. bottom quartile
4. Learn from top performers

**Example Output**:
```
Breast Cancer Screening (C01):
  My Plan: 76% (4‚≠ê)
  Market Median: 73%
  Top Quartile: >80%
  ‚Üí We're above median but not top quartile
```

### 3. Financial Impact Analysis

**Question**: What's the revenue impact of moving from 3.5 to 4 stars?

**Approach**:
1. Get current enrollment
2. Get average premium
3. Calculate bonus payment (5% for 4+ stars)
4. Multiply: Enrollment √ó Premium √ó 5% √ó 12 months

**Example Calculation**:
```
Enrollment: 10,000 members
Premium: $150/month
Bonus: 5%
Annual Impact: 10,000 √ó $150 √ó 5% √ó 12 = $900,000/year
```

### 4. Parent Organization Analysis

**Question**: How do all our brands perform across our enterprise?

**Approach**:
1. Aggregate all contracts under same parent organization
2. Calculate average ratings
3. Identify best practices from high performers
4. Find struggling contracts that need support

**Example Output**:
```
UnitedHealth Group:
  Total Contracts: 45
  Average Overall Rating: 3.7
  4+ Stars: 15 contracts (33%)
  Top Performer: H1537 (4.5‚≠ê)
  Needs Support: H0360 (2.5‚≠ê)
```

### 5. Special Needs Plan (SNP) Analysis

**Question**: Do SNPs perform differently than general plans?

**Approach**:
1. Segment contracts by SNP flag
2. Compare average ratings and measure performance
3. Understand unique challenges of serving special populations
4. Identify SNP-specific best practices

**Example Insight**:
```
SNPs vs. General Plans:
  SNPs: 3.4 average overall (N=350)
  General Plans: 3.6 average overall (N=420)
  ‚Üí SNPs slightly lower, likely due to higher-risk populations
  ‚Üí But top SNPs (H1290, H1045) achieve 4.5-5.0 stars!
```
