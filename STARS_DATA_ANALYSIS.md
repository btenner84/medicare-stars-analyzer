# Medicare Advantage Stars Rating System - Deep Dive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D Prescription Drug Plan Stars rating system is CMS's quality rating system that evaluates Medicare Advantage and Part D plans on a 1 to 5-star scale. This analysis covers the 2026 Star Ratings data structure and methodology.

---

## System Overview

### What is Stars?

The Stars rating system measures the quality of health and drug services Medicare Advantage and Part D plans provide. Higher star ratings indicate better plan performance across multiple dimensions:

- **5 stars** = Excellent
- **4 stars** = Above Average  
- **3 stars** = Average
- **2 stars** = Below Average
- **1 star** = Poor

### Why Stars Matter

1. **Financial Impact**: Plans with 4+ stars receive bonus payments from CMS (up to 5% premium increase)
2. **Consumer Choice**: Ratings are displayed on Medicare.gov Plan Finder 
3. **Marketing**: 5-star plans can market year-round
4. **Regulatory**: Low-performing plans face intervention/termination

## Stars Methodology Deep Dive

### Star Assignment Process

#### Step 1: Measure-Level Stars

For each measure, the raw performance value is compared against the cut point thresholds:

**Example: C14 (Controlling High Blood Pressure)**
- Plan A reports: 82%
- Cut points:
  - 1 star: < 67%
  - 2 stars: 67% to < 75%
  - 3 stars: 75% to < 80%
  - 4 stars: 80% to < 86%
  - 5 stars: ≥ 86%
- **Result**: 82% falls in 4-star range → Plan A gets 4 stars for C14

#### Step 2: Domain-Level Aggregation

Stars at the measure level are averaged within each domain:

**Example: HD1 Domain (Staying Healthy)**
- C01: 4 stars
- C02: 4 stars  
- C03: 3 stars
- C04: 3 stars
- C05: 4 stars
- C06: 3 stars
- **Domain Average**: (4+4+3+3+4+3)/6 = 3.5 stars

#### Step 3: Summary Rating Calculation

**Part C Summary**:
- Weighted average of Part C domain scores
- Different domains have different weights based on importance
- Categorical Adjustment Index (CAI) applied for case-mix
- Reward factors for high performance in key measures

**Part D Summary**:  
- Weighted average of Part D domain scores
- Similar weighting and adjustment methodology

**Overall Rating**:
- Combination of Part C and Part D summaries
- For MA-PD contracts, typically uses both
- Rounded to nearest 0.5 stars

### Special Adjustments

**1. Categorical Adjustment Index (CAI)**
- Accounts for enrollee health status differences
- Plans serving sicker populations get credit

**2. Reward Factors**
- High performance in certain measures can boost ratings
- Particularly for patient safety and clinical outcomes

**3. Improvement Measures**
- Plans showing significant improvement get credit
- C04, C05 measure improvement, not just absolute level

**4. Hold Harmless**
- New contracts exempt for first 3 years
- Disaster-impacted plans get relief (see Disaster % columns)

**5. Low Enrollment**
- Plans < 11 enrollees: "Plan too small to be measured"
- Some measures require minimum sample sizes

---

## Measurement Periods

Different measures use different data collection periods:

### Administrative Claims Data (Most Part C measures)
- **Period**: 01/01/2024 – 12/31/2024
- **Examples**: C01, C02, C08-C14, C17-C19, D08-D12
- **Source**: Claims submitted by providers

### CAHPS® Survey Data (Member Experience)
- **Period**: 03/2025 – 05/2025 (surveys sent)
- **Examples**: C22-C27, D05-D06
- **Source**: Member surveys

### HOS Survey Data (Health Outcomes)
- **Period**: 07/17/2024 – 11/01/2024
- **Examples**: C04-C06, C15-C16
- **Source**: Health Outcomes Survey

### Operational Data
- **Period**: Various (often rolling 12 months)
- **Examples**: C28-C29, C31-C32, D02-D03
- **Source**: CMS administrative systems

### Pharmacy Data
- **Period**: 01/01/2024 – 12/31/2024 or 01/01/2024 – 09/30/2024
- **Examples**: D07-D12
- **Source**: Pharmacy claims

**Key Insight**: 2026 Star Ratings are based primarily on 2024 performance data! There's a 1-year lag.

## Analytical Insights

### Distribution Analysis

From the Summary Ratings data, we can observe:

**Overall Rating Distribution** (approximate from sample):
- 5.0 stars: ~2-3% (rare, elite performers)
- 4.5 stars: ~8-10%
- 4.0 stars: ~20-25%
- 3.5 stars: ~30-35% (most common)
- 3.0 stars: ~20-25%
- 2.5 stars: ~8-10%
- Below 2.5: ~2-3%

### Performance Patterns by Measure Type

**Clinical Measures** (C08-C21):
- Generally higher performance (more 4-5 stars)
- Based on claims data, easier to document
- Examples: Medication reviews (C08) often 90%+

**Screenings** (C01-C03):
- Moderate performance (3-4 stars typical)
- Challenges: Member compliance, outreach effectiveness
- Flu vaccine (C03) often lower due to timing/uptake

**CAHPS Measures** (C22-C27):
- Subjective, harder to control
- Scores cluster around 80-90 range
- Small improvements can shift stars

**Readmissions** (C18):
- Lower is better (unique!)
- Critical for summary rating
- High weight in calculations

**Medication Adherence** (D08-D10):
- Often 85-92% range
- Key Part D differentiator
- Pharmacy partnerships critical

### Strategic Recommendations

**For Health Plans**:

1. **Low-Hanging Fruit**: Target measures 1-2 percentage points from next star threshold
2. **Focus on Weights**: Prioritize high-weight measures (C18, adherence measures)
3. **Member Experience**: Invest in CAHPS improvement (surveys = perception)
4. **Clinical Outcomes**: Build disease management programs (diabetes, hypertension)
5. **Operational Excellence**: Improve appeals timeliness, reduce complaints

**For Regulators/Researchers**:

1. **Parent Organization Analysis**: Study best practices from high-performing systems
2. **SNP Performance**: Understand unique challenges, consider separate benchmarks  
3. **Disaster Impact**: Quantify relief mechanisms' effectiveness
4. **Market Competition**: Analyze rating distribution by geographic market
5. **Longitudinal Trends**: Track measure performance over time (requires multi-year data)

## Data Quality Considerations

### Special Values Interpretation

| Value | Meaning | Impact on Rating |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Plan too small to be measured | < 11 enrollees or insufficient sample | Measure excluded from calculations |
| Not enough data available | Sample size requirements not met | Measure excluded from calculations |
| Plan not required to report | Exemption (e.g., PDP not reporting Part C) | Expected, no penalty |
| Plan too new to be measured | Contract in first 3 years | Full exemption period |
| No data available | Missing submission or system issue | Potentially problematic, investigate |
| Medicare shows only Star Rating | Raw value suppressed for privacy | Star rating still calculated |

### Data Validation Checks

**Recommended Validation Rules**:

1. **Range Checks**:
   - Percentages: 0% to 100%
   - Scores: Within measure-specific bounds
   - Star ratings: 1 to 5 (integers)

2. **Consistency Checks**:
   - Star rating matches raw value + cut points
   - Summary rating aligns with measure stars
   - Contract type matches required measures

3. **Completeness Checks**:
   - All contracts have required measures
   - No unexpected null values
   - Measurement periods align with specifications

4. **Cross-File Validation**:
   - Contract IDs match across all files
   - Same number of data rows in Measure Data & Measure Stars
   - Summary Ratings includes all contracts from other files
