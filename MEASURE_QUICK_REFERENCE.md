## Organization Type Differences

### MA-Only (H-contracts, no drug)
- Reports: C01-C33 only
- Part D summary: "Not Applicable"
- Overall rating: Based on Part C only

### MA-PD (H-contracts with drug)
- Reports: C01-C33 + D01-D12
- Uses MA-PD thresholds for Part D
- Overall rating: Combines Part C and Part D

### PDP (S-contracts, drug only)
- Reports: D01-D12 only
- Uses PDP thresholds (stricter than MA-PD)
- Part C summary: "Not Applicable"
- Overall rating: Based on Part D only

### SNP (Special Needs Plans)
- Can be MA-only or MA-PD
- Must report C07 (SNP Care Management)
- May have different performance patterns

## Color Coding for Quick Scanning

In reports, consider using:

- 🟢 **Green**: 4-5 stars (above average)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: 3 stars (average)
- 🟠 **Orange**: 2 stars (below average)
- 🔴 **Red**: 1 star (needs urgent attention)
- ⚪ **Gray**: Not enough data / Not required

For inverse measures (C18, C28-C29, D02-D03), flip the logic!

---

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with Summary**: Check overall rating first
2. **Identify gaps**: Focus on 1-2 star measures
3. **Calculate gaps**: How far to next threshold?
4. **Prioritize**: High weight + small gap = quick wins
5. **Benchmark**: Compare to industry percentiles
6. **Track trends**: Multi-year view shows momentum
