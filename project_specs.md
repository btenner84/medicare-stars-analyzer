## Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log

**Decision 1** (Oct 17, 2025): Database choice - Recommend PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: Better support for analytical functions (PERCENTILE_CONT), open-source, strong community
- **Alternative**: MySQL (slightly simpler, wider adoption)

**Decision 2** (Oct 17, 2025): ETL approach - Python + pandas
- **Rationale**: Flexible, handles CSV parsing well, integrates with database, widely known
- **Alternative**: SQL-based ETL (less flexible for complex transformations)

### Open Questions

1. What is the target deployment environment? (on-premise vs. cloud)
2. Who will be the primary system administrator?
3. What level of real-time access is required? (batch vs. live queries)
4. Are there existing BI tools that must be integrated with?
5. What are the data retention policies? (how many years to keep)
